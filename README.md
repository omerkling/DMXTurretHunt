#DMXTurretHung

Simple extended reality (XR) game prototype using the Unreal Engine DMX Plugin (beta in 4.25).

Uses 2 moving head theater lights, one tracks a 'target' bounding around a rectangular arena.
The other tracks mouse clicks and fires a 'laser'. If the laser fires where the ball is supposed
to be, then the target takes damage until it 'explodes', represented by a spinning prism effect.
The turret laser is not shown in the game viewport to promote looking at the physical lights.

This imports the DMXFollowActor from https://github.com/GeodesicGames/DMXTools (the plugin maintainers).
